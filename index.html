				<h2>Origins</h2>
				<p>Created by Charlie Danby in early 2024, the original concept for what would soon become this  company was for it to be a quick and easy buck through selling leftover art supplies that weren't really needed. After gaining popularity it became a place where people could drop off their own leftover art supplies which would be put on shelf to be later sold, it started to become more like an actual company until it actually became a real company one month later. Now, art supplies are shipped from all over the world while still accepting donations from customers, with stores planned to open alongside the creation of this website.</p>
